# Assignment 2 — Chatbot Wireframes (Low-fidelity + Handoff Notes)

## Chat window scaffold
- Header: product name, bot status (online/offline), minimize and settings
- Message area: chronological bubbles, timestamps, and avatars
- Composer: text input, quick-reply buttons, attach file, send

## Bubbles
- User bubble: right-aligned, primary color background for contrast
- Bot bubble: left-aligned, neutral background with subtle elevation and avatar
- System messages: center-aligned with muted styling

## Quick-reply buttons
- Display 3–6 contextually relevant quick replies after bot responses
- Buttons collapse into "more" menu on small screens

## Typing indicator and loading
- Subtle animated dots and skeleton responses for long-running actions

## Handoff and escalation
- CTA in chat: "Escalate to human" opens a short form (email, description, attach logs)

Accessibility notes:
- Ensure contrast between bubble text and background reaches WCAG AA
- Composer supports multiline, keyboard shortcuts, and screen reader labels

# Assignment 1 â€” Concept Note

This concept note summarizes the rationale behind the landing page layout, visual choices, navigation, and accessibility.

The layout prioritizes a concise value proposition in the hero followed by a feature-led content path that progressively reveals technical depth. The color palette uses a confident primary color for CTAs and a neutral background system to keep focus on content and readability. Navigation is shallow and predictable: primary product sections are reachable from the header and repeated CTAs keep conversion opportunities accessible. Brand fit emphasizes trust and enterprise-readiness via case study highlights and clear pricing. Accessibility is baked in: semantic HTML structure, keyboard-focusable controls, ARIA roles for modals and carousels, and color contrasts that meet WCAG AA for text and UI components.

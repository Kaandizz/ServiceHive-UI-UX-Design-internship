# Assignment 2 â€” Concept Note

This concept note captures the design rationale for the chatbot UI and interaction model.

The chatbot follows a minimal, focused interface that prioritizes clarity and speed. A neutral background with a single accent color drives attention to quick-reply CTAs and the message composer. Interaction design focuses on short turn lengths and contextual quick-replies to reduce user effort. The bot is designed to escalate gracefully: when confidence thresholds are low or troubleshooting steps fail, the UI surfaces an "Escalate to human" flow that captures context automatically. Accessibility considerations include keyboard operability for the composer, ARIA live regions for incoming messages, and color contrast checks to ensure legibility in both light and dark themes.
